## Code Guidelines

- **JavaScript only** — no TypeScript, no build step, no transpilation
- **No frameworks** — vanilla JS, vanilla Canvas, vanilla HTTP
- **Tests** — use Jest 30; place test files in `__tests__/`
- **Keep it simple** — avoid abstractions until they're clearly needed

## Architecture Rules

These constraints exist by design. Do not change them:

- **IPC channel names** must remain stable (renderer relies on them)
- **Hook schema** must keep `additionalProperties: true` (future-proofing for new Claude Code fields)
- **Avatar file list** is defined in `public/shared/avatars.json` and `public/shared/sprite-frames.json` (single source of truth) — do not duplicate in individual modules
- **Agent lifecycle** is PID-based only — do not add manual dismiss or timer-based removal

## Art Assets

The pixel art assets in `public/characters/` and `public/office/` are under a [separate restrictive license](LICENSE-ASSETS). Do not modify, redistribute, or include them in other projects.

If you need to test with custom sprites, create your own in a separate directory.
