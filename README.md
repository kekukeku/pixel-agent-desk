> Real-time pixel avatar visualization for Claude Code CLI multi-agent sessions.

Pixel Agent Desk is a standalone Electron app that listens to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) hook events and renders each agent session as an animated pixel character — complete with a virtual office, activity heatmaps, and token usage analytics.

## Highlights

- **Pixel Avatars** — Each agent session gets a unique sprite character with state-driven animations
- **Virtual Office** — 2D pixel art office where characters walk between desks
- **Agent Desk Dashboard** — Web-based monitoring panel with real-time stats (http://localhost:3000)
- **Activity Heatmap** — GitHub-style contribution grid showing daily agent session frequency
- **Token Analytics** — Per-session and aggregate token usage, cost estimates, model breakdowns
- **Terminal Focus** — Click any avatar to bring its terminal window to the foreground
- **PiP Mode** — Always-on-top floating window so your pixel office stays visible while you work
- **Auto Recovery** — Running sessions are automatically restored on app restart
- **Sub-agents & Teams** — Full support for Claude Code sub-agents and team mode

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20 or later
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and configured
- **OS:** Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mgpixelart/pixel-agent-desk.git
cd pixel-agent-desk
npm install
npm start
```

> `npm install` also auto-registers the required Claude Code hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Launch the Electron app |
| `npm run dev` | Development mode (DevTools enabled) |
| `npm test` | Run tests |

## Troubleshooting

**Avatars don't appear**
- Check that hooks are registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Verify the hook server is up: `curl http://localhost:47821/hook` should return 404

**Ghost avatars persist**
- Restart the watcher so future hook payloads include a stable `source`, for example `"source": "custom-watcher"`.
- Custom watcher sessions are restored only when the persisted agent source is `custom-watcher`, `watcher`, or `external-watcher`, and the session id is allowlisted.
- Allowlist custom watcher ids with `~/.pixel-agent-desk/watcher-allowlist.json` (`["GA", "GB"]`, `{ "sessions": ["GA", "GB"] }`, or `{ "GA": true }`). Keys in `~/.pixel-agent-desk/name-map.json` are also treated as allowlisted watcher ids.

**Dashboard won't load**
- Make sure port 3000 is free
